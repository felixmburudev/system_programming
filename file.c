/**
 * @brief This is the main function of the program.
 *
 * The main function opens a file named "txt.txt" in read-write mode using the open() system call.
 * The file is opened with the OLD_P_OVERLAY flag, which is not a standard flag in POSIX.
 * The file permissions are set to 666, which allows read and write access for the owner, group, and others.
 * After opening the file, the file descriptor is stored in the variable 'f'.
 * Finally, the file is closed using the close() system call.
 *
 * @param argc The number of command-line arguments.
 * @param argv An array of strings containing the command-line arguments.
 *
 * @return 0 on successful execution, or a non-zero value on error.
